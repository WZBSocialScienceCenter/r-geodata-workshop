# Plotting with *ggplot2*

The following will only a cover some basic explanations and recipes. I will only show scatterplots as examples, but the basic concepts can be applied to all other kinds of plots. Specifically, geographic plots with `geom_sf()` work in a very similar fashion, only that the coordinate system usually uses geo-locations in longitude / latitude degrees on the x- and y-axis.

For more a more thorough introduction to ggplot2, see [chapter 3 in "R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).

## An example dataset

We'll use the built-in `airquality` dataset:

```{r}
head(airquality)
```

In its very essence, you make a plot by:

1. setting the dataset to use for plotting
2. specifying an ***aesthetics* mapping** that defines which visual properties of the plot are controlled by which variables in your dataset (e.g. variable `Temp` is mapped to the x-coordinate in your plot, `Ozone` is mapped to the y-coordinate)
3. setting a graphical primitive (e.g. a line, points, etc.) to use for plotting one layer of the data; this is called a ***geom***; you may add several layers of different graphical primitives to your plot, e.g. a layer for a line showing a trend and a layer of points that display the individual data points

The first two steps can be done by using the `ggplot()` function. It accepts the dataset to use and an aesthetic mapping which is defined in the function `aes()`. You then add a layer of points via the *geom*-function `geom_point()`.

An example of a scatterplot of `Ozone` on the y-axis against `Temp` on the x-axis:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + geom_point()
```

Be aware that the dataset and the mapping that you pass to `ggplot()` affects all layers unless they define their own data to use and/or aesthetic mapping. For example, we could also refrain from setting a dataset and aesthetic mapping in the `ggplot()` function and instead create two layers of points, each using a different dataset and aesthetic mapping:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
random_data <- data.frame(rand_x = rnorm(10, mean = 75, sd = 20),
                          rand_y = rnorm(10, mean = 100, sd = 30))

ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone), data = airquality) +
    geom_point(aes(x = rand_x, y = rand_y), color = 'red', data = random_data)
```

The first `geom_point()`-layer creates points for the `airquality` data just like before. The second layer uses a dataset with randomly generated values `rand_x` and `rand_y`. Additionally, the color for those points is set to red.

You can see that `geom_point()` has several visual properties (i.e. "aesthetics"): The position on the x and y scale; the color of the points. Some of these properties, like x and y position, are *required*. They must be mapped to a variable or set to a static value, because otherwise you can't draw a point. Others, like `color` are optional and they have reasonable default values. All aesthetics can be mapped to a variable, so we can also map `color` to a variable (note that the variable is converted to an ordered factor, because otherwise the color would be on a continuous scale):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
# here we only pass the dataset to ggplot() and define the aesthetic mapping in the geom layer
ggplot(airquality) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = as.ordered(Month)))
```


In order to find out which visual properties of a geom can be controlled, you can use the help document of the respective function, e.g. `?geom_point` or `?geom_line` and have a look at the section "Aesthetics".

*Overplotting* can easily occur, especially with large data sets.

- happens when multiple data points are drawn on the same spot
- fix it with setting a semi-transparent fill color or apply *jittering*

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.33)  # alpha of 0 is invisible, 1 is opaque
```

## Scales

Each visual property that a variable maps to, belongs to a scale that you can further adjust. For example, you might apply a log-transformation to the x- and/or y-axis. Or you can also change the color palette that is used for the color of points in scatterplot. If a scale uses a legend, you can adjust its appearance, change the title or its position, among other things:


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = as.ordered(Month))) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Spectral', guide = guide_legend(title = 'Month'))
```

## Facets

*Facets* allow you to create small multiples of your plots. Instead of projecting all data points into a single plot, split them into groups depending on a variable and then create a small plot for each group. You can use `facet_wrap()` to do this and specify the variable for splitting as "R formula", e.g. `~ X` where `X` is the variable to split by:


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
    facet_wrap(~ as.ordered(Month))   # make a plot for each month. convert to ordered factor before
```

You can specify more options in `facet_wrap()`, e.g. restrict the number of rows or columns.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(airquality) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
    facet_wrap(~ as.ordered(Month), nrow = 1)
```

By default, all plots share the same scales on the axes which ensures better comparability. However, you can change that using the `scales` argument. 


## Common mistakes

A very common mistake is to accidentally put `+` on a new line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
  + geom_point()
```

`Error: Cannot use "+.gg()" with a single argument. Did you accidentally put + on a new line?`

The `+` operator must appear before the line break (the same is true for other operators like `%>%` used in *dplyr*):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```


The type of your variables determines its scale for plotting. E.g. here you might want to use a discrete scale:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = Month)) +
  geom_point()
```


Converting the numerical to a factor tells ggplot that a discrete scale is appropriate:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone, color = as.factor(Month))) +
  geom_point()
```

# Data linkage with *dplyr*

## Left and right (outer) joins

*Left and right outer joins* keep all observations on the left-hand or right-hand side data sets respectively. Unmatched rows are filled up with *NA*s:

Syntax: `inner_join(a, b, by = <criterion>)`

![Left and right join. Source: Grolemund, Wickham 2017: R for Data Science](figures/join-leftright.png)

## Inner joins

An *inner join* matches keys that appear in both data sets and returns the combined observations:

![Inner join. Source: Grolemund, Wickham 2017: R for Data Science](figures/join-inner.png)

Syntax: `inner_join(a, b, by = <criterion>)`

## Specifying matching criteria

Parameter `by` can be:

1. a character string specifying the key for both sides, e.g.: `inner_join(pm, city_coords, by = 'city')` will match `city` column in `pm` with `city` column in `city_coords`;
2. a vector of character strings specifying several keys to match both sides, e.g.: `inner_join(pm, city_coords, by = c('city', 'country')` will match those rows, where `city` *and* `country` columns match;
3. a *named* character string vector like `inner_join(pm, city_coords, by = c('cityname' = 'id')`, which will match the column `cityname` in `pm` with the column `id` in `city_coords`


# Specific hints / further information for excercises

## Exercise 2

### Finding out geo-coordinates

We will later learn how to use the Google Maps API to geocode (i.e. get the geo-coordinates) places programmatically. For the purpose of this excerise, it's enough to do it manually.

There are several websites that offer free manual geocoding, e.g.:

- https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geocoder/
- https://www.mapdevelopers.com/geocode_tool.php

Both work the same way: You enter a request (i.e. an address, city name, restaurant name, etc.) and it spits out the result, including the longitude and latitude. **Please be aware that the first service returns the geo-coordinate with latitude first, followed by longitude ("Location: ...").**

### Constructing a dataset quickly from within R

You can construct the small dataset directly within R, by passing place labels, longitude and latitudes as separate column vectors:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
places <- data.frame(
    label = c('born', 'living', 'neven been there'),
    lng = c(  12.590, 13.402,   8.0456),
    lat = c(  51.279, 52.520,   52.276)
)
```

### Loading the worldmap dataset

The following loads the world map dataset from the `maps` package as *Simple Features* spatial dataset:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(maps)
library(sf)

worldmap_data <- st_as_sf(map('world', plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
```


### Filtering the worldmap dataset

You can filter the worldmap data from the `maps` package by using the "ID" column:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sweden <- worldmap_data[worldmap_data$ID == 'Sweden',]
```

Using the `%in%` operator when selecting several countries:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scandinavia <- worldmap_data[worldmap_data$ID %in% c('Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Finland',
                                                     'Norway', 'Iceland'),]
```


### Restricting the display window

You can specify a "display window" (i.e. "zooming in" to a certain region) by setting a limit on the displayed longitude range (`xlim`) and latitude range (`ylim`) in the `coord_sf()` function:

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = worldmap_data) + coord_sf(xlim = c(-20, 50), ylim = c(30, 70))
```

We will learn more options on how to specify display windows in the second part of the workshop.

## Exercise 3

### Loading and filtering the worldmap dataset

See hints in exercise 2.

### Grouping and counting

You can use the function `group_by()` from the package `dplyr` to group the dataset and then pass the groups to the function `count()` to count observations in each group. For example, if you want to group the dataset `msleep` by variable `vore` and count the observations in each group, you can do so as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)  # for the "msleep" example dataset

group_by(msleep, vore) %>% count()
```

You can also group by several variables, for example by each combination of the variables `vore` and `order` that exist in the dataset:

```{r}
group_by(msleep, vore, order) %>% count() %>%  # group and count by variables "vore" and "order"
    ungroup() %>% sample_n(5)                  # show only a sample of 5 rows
```

For the given task, you must group the observations by city **and** city longitude/latitude.

### Restricting the display window

See hints in exercise 2.

## Exercise 4

When loading the `bln_plr_sozind_data.csv` dataset, make sure that the variable `SCHLUESSEL` is loaded as character string, **not** as integer (use `colClasses = c('SCHLUESSEL' = 'character')` in `read.csv()`).

After loading the spatial dataset `bln_plr.geojson` make sure to set the CRS: `st_crs(<DATASET>) <- 25833`.

- source: Berlin Senate Dept. for Urban Dev. and Housing, *Monitoring Soziale Stadtentwicklung 2017* via [FIS-Broker](https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/index.jsp)
- variables:
    - `STATUS1`: Unemployment rate 2016 in percent
    - `STATUS2`: Long term unemployment rate 2016 in percent
    - `STATUS3`: Pct. of households that obtain social support ("Hartz IV") 2016
    - `STATUS4`: Portion of children under 15 living in household that obtains social support ("Hartz IV") 2016
    - `DYNAMO1` to `4`: Change in the above indicators from the previous year

## Exercise 5

After loading the spatial dataset `nutsrg_2_2016_epsg3857_20M.json` make sure to set the CRS: `st_crs(<DATASET>) <- 3857`.

More information on the `tgs00010_unempl_nuts2.csv` dataset:

- source: [Eurostats / Regions & cities](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions/data/main-tables)
- variables:
    - `sex`: `F` means unemployment rate for women, `M` for men, `T` for both
    - `nuts`: NUTS level-2 region code
    - `year`: year when the data was collected
    - `unempl_pct`: unemployment rate in percent
